# PickAName
-- PROJECT IN PROGRESS --

## About a concept
PickAName should help parents-to-be to find a name for their child. After choosing a sex, they get a random name and decide if they like it or not. From likes they get a list of top names.

In the future I'm going to learn React Native and change it to a real application. 

## Used technologies/tools
* ReactJS
* Sass
* Webpack
* Firebase
